# Final Project for IT 261

## PHP web application

### "Movie Club"
A movie club website similar to IMDB

Final project for this class was to create a web application that demonstrated an understanding of PHP and some basic form handliong, as well as database integration.

In particular, this website is a "Movie Club" that contains a database of movies. Viewers must create a profile and login to view the page. Users can contact the owner with suggestions to add to the list. Each list item has an associated "view" that goes into further detail about the movie. There is also a page that contains a PHP switch, that switches depending on the day of the week. 

This website is responsive/movbile friendly.
