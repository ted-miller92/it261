<!--here are my errors-->
<!-- line 22: mistyped assignment, was "-=", changed to "="-->
<!-- line 22: num2 was mistyped as Num2-->
<!-- line 23: embedded variables incorrectly -->
<!-- line 24: moved inline styles to <p> tag -->
<!-- line 24: corrected embedded variable -->
<!-- line 24: removed unnecessary line break in document formatting, left the <br> tag -->
<!-- line 25: missing semi-colon -->
<!-- line 25: missing closing <p> tag -->
<!-- line 27: missing closing php tag-->
<!-- HTML: organized and added appropriate indentation to make it actually legible-->
<!-- Opening form tag had unnecessary escape character-->
<!-- submit input element had misplaced closing brace-->
<!-- input name attribute for num1 had mistyped as Num1-->
<!-- missing opening/closing label tags for both number inputs-->
<!-- this crazy thing: ';{?> was at the end of the document -->

<!-- a major reason for the logic not working was that the form had no method attribute. I assigned it the "post" method.-->
<!-- also moved the php block to after the form to match the assignment-->

<!-- there was also a missing closing h2 tag-->
